Here is a quick code snippet in Python that contains a logic mistake, along with a prompt you could use to ask a Grok-powered bot for review:


(The mistake: the function currently returns True when the number is odd, not even.)

### Review Prompt

"Hey Grok, can you review this function and let me know if it correctly checks if a number is even? Please explain any issues you find and suggest a fix, but try to make your feedback entertaining!"

```python
def is_even(n):
    # This should return True if n is even, False otherwise
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
Using this review prompt should trigger Grok to provide not just a technical correction but potentially a witty or playful response, helping to reveal Grok's characteristic style and reasoning ability in code review scenarios.[1][3][7]
